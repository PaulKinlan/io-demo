# Progress

_This document tracks what currently works, what remains to be built, the overall project status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions._

## What Works

_(List the features or components that are currently functional.)_

- Memory Bank structure initialized.
- Basic project file structure created:
  - `index.html`
  - `css/style.css`
  - `js/main.js`
  - `images/` directory
  - `audio/` directory
- Development environment setup:
  - npm initialized (`package.json`)
  - Vite installed
  - Vite scripts added to `package.json`

## What's Left to Build

_(Outline the remaining tasks, features, or components.)_

- Complete Memory Bank updates (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) for the Language Learning Tool.
- Implement core Language Learning Tool features:
  - Image input (camera/file selection).
  - Language selection UI (customizable selects with flags).
  - Image description generation (Prompt API integration).
  - Question generation (Prompt API integration).
  - Question display carousel (HTML/CSS implementation).
  - Answer modal dialog (HTML/CSS/JS for `<dialog>`).
  - Answer evaluation and feedback (Prompt API integration).

## Current Status

_(Provide a brief summary of the project's current state.)_

- Project Pivot: Shifted from IO Demo to Language Learning Tool.
- Development Environment Setup: npm and Vite have been configured.
- Documentation Update Phase: Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated to reflect the pivot and dev environment setup. `systemPatterns.md` still needs review/update for the new project scope.

## Known Issues

_(List any bugs, limitations, or areas needing improvement.)_

- TBD

## Evolution of Decisions

_(Track significant changes in direction, requirements, or technical approach over time.)_

- **[Date of Change - e.g., 2025-04-10]:** Project pivoted from a general Chrome features demo (IO Demo) to a specific Language Learning Tool application based on updated `projectbrief.md`. Core requirements now focus on image-based question generation and answering using the Prompt API.
