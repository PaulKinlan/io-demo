# Active Context

_This document tracks the current focus of work, recent changes, immediate next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and key learnings._

## Current Focus

_(What is the main area of work right now?)_

- Aligning Memory Bank documentation with the new project brief (Language Learning Tool).
- Preparing for initial implementation of the language tool features.

## Recent Changes

_(List significant changes made in the last work session.)_

- Created core Memory Bank files (initial templates).
- Created basic project structure:
  - `index.html` (with basic boilerplate)
  - `css/style.css` (with basic reset)
  - `js/main.js` (with console log)
  - `images/` directory (with `.keep` file)
  - `audio/` directory (with `.keep` file)
- Rewrote `productContext.md` to reflect the Language Learning Tool concept.
- Initialized npm (`package.json`).
- Installed Vite as a development dependency.
- Added npm scripts (`dev`, `build`, `preview`) for Vite.
- Updated `techContext.md` with Vite setup details.

## Next Steps

_(What are the immediate tasks to be done?)_

- Update remaining Memory Bank files (`progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`) to align with the new project brief and recent changes.
- Start the Vite development server using `npm run dev`.
- Begin Phase 2: Initial code implementation (modifying `index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`) based on the updated documentation.
- Implement image input functionality (camera/file).
- Implement language selection UI (customizable selects).
